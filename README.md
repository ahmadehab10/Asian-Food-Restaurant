# Asian-Food-Restaurant

Problem Statement:

Danny has a new startup restaurant and wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better experience for his customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided me with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions

Skills Applied:

SQL,
CTE's,
Windows Functions,
Aggregations,
Joins.

Insights:

Customer B is the most frequent visitor with 6 visits 

Danny’s Restaurant's most popular item is ramen, followed by curry and sushi.

Customer A loves ramen, Customer C loves only ramen whereas Customer B seems to enjoy sushi, curry and ramen equally.

The last item ordered by Customers A and B before they became members are sushi and curry. Does it mean both of these items are the deciding factor?
