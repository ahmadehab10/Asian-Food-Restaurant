# Asian-Food-Restaurant
In this project I had data from a small sized new restaurant that was trying to gain insights from their data as to what was the favorite items on the menu, customer Visiting Patterns, Customer expenditure and whether to expand their existing loyalty membership program. 
My objective was to create simple datasets out of his data in order for him to read the data easily and also to provide him with a simple dashboard.
Firstly I explored the dataset in MySql answering the questions that he had by utilizing joins and many sql statements to create views for each queston, I then Recreated a new table that was more organized
Next I exported hese views as csv files into powerbi where I created Vizualisations that answered their questions and gave them some clear insights from their data in order to help them with their decision-making process.

Problem Statement:
Danny has a new startup restaurant and wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better experience for his customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided me with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions
